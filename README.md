# Project Overview

- ### This is a project that I am using to familiarize myself more with the Angular framework. This project lays out different 'properties' in different cities. I pre-configured most of the requirements following this initial guide --> [Guide](https://v17.angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-01). My improvement includes moving away from using locally served data and instead pulling it from a dynamic API using a mock API I set up using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/), which includes the same data schema. You may compare the differences in repos using the original setup StackBlitz at --> [Original Repo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/wxoqzmx8?file=src%2Fmain.ts).


## How to run:

- Install dependencies through `npm install`

- Serve app through local host by running `ng serve` or `npm start`


## TODOS:

- Must hide the API information being passed in the `housing.service.ts` file. This is to be done by any contributor or myself at a later time. 

- Contenerize app with Docker. This is to be done by any contributor or myself at a later time.
